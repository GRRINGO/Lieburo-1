* src/  for all the source code

You can write a short summary of your project into this file.
This file is read by the gitlab and is shown on the repository's front page.

To compile and run the program you will to install Box2d and SFML on your computer. Instructions for Box2d and SFML can be found from following links:

-SFML: http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.3/start-linux.php

After installing those you can compile program with command "make all" and run it with command "make run" or just just the latter to compile and run at the same time. In case of any problems you can try command "make clean" to remove *.o files and to try to compile it with better success.
